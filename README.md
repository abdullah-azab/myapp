# React app

this app is my first react app created to implement :

  - designe patterns (singilton ,Observer).
  - reusable and independint componants.
  - tested using Node js Api with Mongo DB .
  - deployed using gh-pages and firebase .

### Demo
you can see it in action [here](https://abdullahazab.github.io/myapp/
)

### Technology

this app uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Node.js] - to drive the backend Api managing the mongoDB. 
* [React JS] - the platform on witch the app is based.
* [mongoDB] - the data base used in designe and testing.
* [bootstrap] -mobile-first front-end web development. 
* [gh-pages]-publish website to a gh-pages branch on GitHub.
* [firebase]-for the database firestore solution is used in deployment.
* [create-react-app]-simple way to handle the dependencies.



### Todos

 - improve front end
 - experement with Redux
